I would like to become a JavaScript Full stack developer. So, All my learnings should come hear.

These are just a list of sample projects done in the process of learning various aspects of full stack development using JavaScript.

List is as follows:
1. Guess a Number.
  * Guess a random number between 1 and 20. Guess quick, make your highscore.
2. Pig Game.
  * Dice game. Two player game. First one to reach 20 points wins. Make sure to hold your points(If dice == 1, you lose your score and chance will be given to opponent).
